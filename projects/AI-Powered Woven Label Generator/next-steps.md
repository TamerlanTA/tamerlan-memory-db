## Immediate

- Set `RESEND_API_KEY` in production
- Set `RESEND_FROM_EMAIL` to a verified Griffes Vivienne sender
- Optionally set `RESEND_REPLY_TO_EMAIL`
- Redeploy the app after Resend env setup
- Run one live or staging preorder submission and confirm the transactional email is received
- Confirm `preorder_submissions.confirmationEmailStatus = sent` on a successful live test
- Rotate the Railway DB credential because the full `DATABASE_URL` was exposed in chat
- Run browser-based visual QA for:
  - desktop Home
  - desktop Prepare
  - desktop Result
  - desktop My Account
  - mobile Home
- Confirm the final desktop header is approved by the client after the restoration pass

## Engineering

- Decide whether analytics env vars should be configured or removed from local build expectations
- Evaluate whether bundle splitting is needed after header work is signed off
- If needed later, add an ops resend path for failed confirmation emails without changing the user-facing funnel

## Process / memory

- Correct or clarify the vault path in `~/.codex/AGENTS.md`
- Continue writing session notes directly under the project `sessions/` folder after meaningful work blocks
